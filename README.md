# Hooke
Written in python, and based on quite a few requirements  
  
It is yet to work properly

## Usage
To run a simple textual check:
```python
import Hooke

hk = Hooke() #Inits
hk.Textual(input="test/test.txt") #Runs the comparison
hk.print_matches() #Prints matches and source
hk.time() #Prints time taken
```
