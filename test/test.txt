The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, who discovered this equation in 1965.

Levenshtein distance may also be referred to as edit distance, although it may also denote a larger family of distance metrics. It is closely related to pairwise string alignments.

Definition
Mathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings, a and b (of length |a| and |b| respectively), is given bylev a,b(|a|,|b|) where:

Here, 1(ai≠bi) is the indicator function equal to 0 when ai≠bi and equal to 1 otherwise, and leva, b(i,j) is the distance between the first i characters of a and the first j characters of b.

Note that the first element in the minimum corresponds to deletion (from a to b), the second to insertion and the third to match or mismatch, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same.
